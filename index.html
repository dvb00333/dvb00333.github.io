Hi guys!!! Welcome to my webpage!  This is my favorite dinner recipe.  It is super quick, easy, and <i>100% vegan!</i></p>
<p> I have been a vegan for 11 months! This means I don't eat any meat, dairy products, or eggs. 
Basically anything that comes from an animal!  I am doing this for ethical, environmental, 
and health reasons. A lot of people think that vegans can't eat anything but lettuce, but actually,
there are tons of options! I eat tons of veggies, noodles, and tofu! </p>
<p>I used to LOVE chicken fingers, but now that I'm vegan, they have alternatives! There are tons
of plant-based products (mostly made of soy) that look and taste just like the real thing! Chicken fingers,
hamburgers, meatballs, bacon, and more! If I had known how easy veganism was going to be, I would have
made the switch a long time ago.</p>
<p>I love to cook vegan food and I even run a vegan instagram where I post all of my meals! I love showing people
how easy and delicious veganism can be! Check out my vegan instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/plantbased_princesses/"> here! </a> </p>
<p> Anyways, here is one of my favorite dinner recipes.  It is super quick, easy, and <i>100% vegan! </p>
